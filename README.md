# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the comprehensive repository of data structures and algorithms, primarily implemented in C++ with a bit of Java! 🚀📊 This repository aims to provide clear explanations, test cases, and solutions that range from naive brute force to highly optimized approaches.

## 📚 Features

- **Wide Range of Algorithms**: Covers various data structures and algorithms including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Multiple Approaches**: Solutions from naive brute force to optimized algorithms.
- **Complete Examples**: Each implementation includes a full code example with a main function for easy testing.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Clear explanations to help understand the concepts and implementations.

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imShubh03/data-structures-algorithms.git
```

## 🧭Navigate to the desired directory and

compile the C++ code using:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp
./a.exe (for windows) ans ./a.out (for linux)
```

compile the Java code using:
```bash
javac filename.java
java classname
```

## 📄 Usage
Each algorithm or data structure is provided in its own file with a main function to demonstrate its functionality. You can run the examples to see the implementation in action.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing
