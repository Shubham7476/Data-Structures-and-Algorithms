# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the comprehensive repository of data structures and algorithms, primarily implemented in C++ with a bit of Java! 🚀📊 This repository aims to provide clear explanations, test cases, and solutions that range from naive brute force to highly optimized approaches.

## 📚 Features

- **Wide Range of Algorithms**: Covers various data structures and algorithms including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Multiple Approaches**: Solutions from naive brute force to optimized algorithms.
- **Complete Examples**: Each implementation includes a full code example with a main function for easy testing.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Clear explanations to help understand the concepts and implementations.
